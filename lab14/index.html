			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with going back to old labs and debugging them. The bonus task involved setting up breakpoints in code and answering questions in Stack Overflow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have many issues with prior assignments that I couldn't fix, I'm already familiar with using breakpoints as a form of debugging (it's usually my first tool I use), and I didn't feel like making a new account on Stack Overflow at the moment. So I guess I'm not doing anything for this lab? Maybe my partner could use some help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't put all that much energy into this assignment, since I had already spent the time and effort ahead of time making sure all previous assignments worked just fine. I did help Austin a little with his work though, making sure that it worked correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This lab assignment doesn't have results to output.</p>
