			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked to structure our lab folders and files in a specific hierarchy. We were also tasked to edit our homepage and lab 3 HTML and CSS files by imbedding an image and incorporating links to other lab pages.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some overlapping of elements on the homepage when I floated my image, so I had to look up the specific mechanics of margins, borders, and padding in CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the entire lab assignment went very smoothly. We had a few hiccups here and there due to small syntax errors or typos, but nothing that couldn't be resolved quickly and efficiently.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
