					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating a button using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create fake dialogue within a webpage using the 'lorem ipsum' filler text. The bonus tasks involved using CSS to switch the text between left and right, and creating a text input that didn't pull random slices of the prewritten filler text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This time around, I didn't run into any problems. Everything worked the first time around, including the bonus tasks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I didn't spend as much effort on this assignment as the last one because it was so straightforward. I used an array of strings to pull from for the fake dialogue, and then implemented a similar random element selector from a previous assignment for this assignment.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are the results of the script output:</p>
