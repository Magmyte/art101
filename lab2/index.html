					<h1>Hello World</h1>
					<p>Charles is an Arts & Design: Games and Playable Media major at UC Santa Cruz. He focuses his efforts on systems design and creative direction, and is also a 2D digital illustrator on the side. He spends way too much of his time being a massive snob about his favorite forms of entertainment in film, TV, and especially games. Other than being an amateur media analyst, Charles is a big fan of Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, and Pathfinder 2nd Edition. Rory Teeter is a third-year sociology major at UCSC. They are originally from Los Angeles and hope to move to San Francisco after college. They like playing with their cat Juno, crocheting, and Sudoku in their free time, and are currently working as a childrenâ€™s aide in Santa Cruz.</p> <!--Write text about the two of us.-->

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>For this lab assignment, we were instructed to edit an HTML and CSS file, which would affect the appearance of a webpage given our parameters that we chose.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One immediate issue that cropped up was the discrepancy between the lab's tasks and the template we were already given. The lab instructed us to create our own HTML and CSS files, but the template given by Professor Modes already included HTML and CSS files that we edited.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went rather smoothly. We had few hiccups along the way, managed to complete the entire assignment as well as the bonus task in a timely manner. I felt that I spent most of my energy learning HTML and CSS syntax, but that's okay because I already have familiarity with programming.</p>
