			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating Javascript code that takes an user input and alphabetizes the input. There were also additional tasks related to alphabetizing without regard to upper or lowercase, removing spaces, shuffling the characters, properly capitalizing first letters, and outputting the returned name using styled CSS.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While the main task of the assignment was essentially trivial, as the lab assignment examples provided me with everything I needed to know in order to do the tasks, the bonus tasks proved a little more difficult as I didn't have experience with Javascript and some of its intricacies prior to this course. I went online to look at Javascript documentation in more details, and had to fix some of my functions as I hadn't realized certain operations would output a return if they weren't being used to assign variables, and that issue caused some of my loops to quit. In the end, however, I managed to work out everything in the end.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						The standard task of the assignment was very straightforward and I did not have any issues with it.<br><br>

						For Task X-1, I searched Stack Overflow and found the localeCompare function, which worked for this problem relatively simply when combined with the sort function inputs.<br><br>

						For Task X-2, I found the replace function, which was simple to integrate as all I needed to do was replace any instance of " " with "".<br><br>

						For Task X-3, this was tricky. I created an additional array that held individual words, and implemented a for loop and a new shuffle function that made all the letters lowercase and scrambled the letters in each word of that array, and then capitalized the first letter of the word. Then, I ran another for loop that added all of the scrambled words in the array to a new string, and returned that string.<br><br>

						For Task X-4, it was just a matter of having the Javascript code return a string including the dividers and ID marker, and then using that ID marker in the CSS file.<br><br>

						For Task X-5, this was one of the first bonus tasks I did. I initialize the variable outside of the functions at the very top of the programming block, and then use that variable as an input for every function, so every function uses the same input, which is only prompted for once.</br>
