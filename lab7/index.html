					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating Javascript code that takes an user input and alphabetizes the input. There were also additional tasks related to alphabetizing without regard to upper or lowercase, removing spaces, shuffling the characters, properly capitalizing first letters, and outputting the returned name using styled CSS.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While the main task of the assignment was essentially trivial, as the lab assignment examples provided me with everything I needed to know in order to do the tasks, the bonus tasks proved a little more difficult as I didn't have experience with Javascript and some of its intricacies prior to this course. I went online to look at Javascript documentation in more details, and had to fix some of my functions as I hadn't realized certain operations would output a return if they weren't being used to assign variables, and that issue caused some of my loops to quit. In the end, however, I managed to work out everything in the end.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						The standard task of the assignment was very straightforward and I did not have any issues with it.

						For Task X-1, I searched Stack Overflow and found the localeCompare function, which worked for this problem.
