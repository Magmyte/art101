					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with using jQuery in order to create buttons on a webpage. Those buttons would be interactive, and would change the CSS styling of the section they were connected to. The bonus task was related to refactoring the Javascript code such that it was optimized for use on multiple sections at once.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I forgot to add the proper IDs to the section dividers the first time around, and was confused about why my button didn't show up. That was resolved fairly quickly. However, when I attempted the bonus task, it was significantly more troublesome to implement. I couldn't figure out what the issue was until I searched up my problem, and I realized that HTML has a quirk where IDs have to be unique while classes can be repeated on a page. Once I switched any reference to an ID in both my HTML and Javascript code to a class instead, everything worked perfect.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I ended up putting a fairly concerted amount of effort into this lab assignment because the appending of a button and a button click function was new to me - I'm much more familiar with programs that involve algorithms involving things like computing mathematical functions and solving for more abstract processes like the shuffling of characters in a string and such.</p>
