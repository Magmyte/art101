			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with configuring a webpage that featured a button, which would fetch an API once clicked and display information based on the fetched API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I kept running into an issue where CORS policy would block AJAX from fetching the JSON from the website, and this was rather frustrating because all of the various websites I visited would run into this issue. Not even a CORS unblocker extension worked, and I didn't want to use it because I couldn't assume that anybody viewing my webpage would have that extension installed. Thus, I eventually resorted to finding a REST API that was CORS-friendly and used that as my API instead.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of effort into this assignment, since I'm not familiar with APIs at all, and I had a lot of issues fetching JSONs from APIs due to the CORS policy mentioned earlier. At the end of the day, I did get an API to work correctly, but it came after a lot of frustration and effort spent in order to get working.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here are the results of the script output:</p>
					<p>Activate to get a random cat!</p>
					<button id="activate">Activate</button><br>
