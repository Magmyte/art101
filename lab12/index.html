			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with creating Javascript code with conditionals that would return a certain string depending on the input provided by the user. The bonus tasks involved things such as adding images, refactoring the code, using a different algorithm for the returned value, and such.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Throughout the course of the lab assignment, I didn't have any issues, since I'm very familiar with these kinds of conditionals and algorithms from my experience with object-oriented programming in other languages such as Python, C++, and Java.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the lab assignment went well. It was mildly amusing to revisit the sensation of tinkering with algorithms like I used to back in high school, and think critically about how to solve problems efficiently and elegantly with programming. At the end of the day, this is what I enjoy about programming.</p>
