					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were tasked with fetching the XKCD API and using that API to display a comic on a webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into the same CORS policy issue as before, but someone else in the course used a CORS proxy site that could fetch the API. I used that proxy to fetch the JSON data, which then allowed me to display the title, image, and alt text on my own webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put in a fair amount of effort into this assignment, making sure that it worked correctly after a significant amount of time dealing with bypassing the CORS policy issue. Afterwards, I implemented an algorithm to call a random XKCD comic and display that on my own webpage.</p>
