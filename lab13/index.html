			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>For this lab, we were tasked with writing Javascript code that incorporated loops in order to perform
					certain functions in reponse to some input. The bonus tasks involved creating input fields for users
					to input their own strings to be placed with regards to certain numbers associated with the original
					task, and to neatly form multiple columns with the output.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>For the core tasks of the lab assignment, I didn't have any issues, since I'm very familiar with
					loops and conditionals from my time working with algorithms in high school. I looked over some of my
					previous assignments in order to complete the bonus tasks, but those worked just fine with just a
					bit of work and a bit of debugging by parsing a string into a number.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I put a fairly significant effort into this assignment, since I went out of my way in order to
					complete the bonus tasks in addition to the core tasks, and I was able to successfully complete the
					algorithm needed to perform the tasks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Choose up to four factors and a phrase for each:</p>

				<input type="number" id="inputNum1" value=3> <input type="text" id="inputText1" value="Fizz"><br>
				<input type="number" id="inputNum2" value=4> <input type="text" id="inputText2" value="Buzz"><br>
				<input type="number" id="inputNum3" value=5> <input type="text" id="inputText3" value="Boom"><br>
				<input type="number" id="inputNum4" value=7> <input type="text" id="inputText4" value="Bang"><br>

				<p>And the final number to stop at:</p>

				<input type="number" id="inputNumMax" value=99><br><br>

				<button id="button">Submit</button><br><br>
